    Our IT Company wanted to develop a House Rental Management System, a software
application for managing rental properties, which provides CRUD operations for adding,
updating, deleting, and viewing properties.

It deals with three types of properties:
1.Apartments,
2.Houses and
3. Condos.
Each has its own specific details.

    This system-Application is designed using OOP principles to ensure maintainability,
extensibility, and scalability, and to accommodate future requirements.

    The system also have a report based on some condition available on the records that was created.
